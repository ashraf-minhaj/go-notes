# go-notes
 
## To run
 * Init - `go mod init program_name`
 * Format it - `go fmt`. Why? Because other devs want you to deliver standard code.
 * Run  - `go run .`

## Data types:
 * STRING - "yo bro"
 * RUNES - 'x' (int8, int32)
 * BOOL - true/false
 * NUMBER - integer (int), float (float32, float64)

## zero values
 declare vars without assigning anything in it.
 * int - 0
 * float - 0.0
 * bool - false
 * string - '' (empty string)


## Notes:
 * go is a statically typed language. If you type wrong type of value in the wrong place, go will let you know.
